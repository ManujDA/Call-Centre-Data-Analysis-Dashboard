# Call Centre Data Analysis Dashboard

This project involves developing a Power BI dashboard for a telecom call centre to visualise and analyse operational performance. The primary goal is to deliver actionable insights that drive improvements in customer satisfaction, agent productivity and overall efficiency.


## How to Use the Dashboard
1. Download the Power BI `.pbix` file from the repository.
2. Open the file in Power BI Desktop.
3. Use the interactive filters to explore metrics by agent, time or call topic.
4. Analyse the visuals to identify trends and actionable insights.

## Stakeholder Requirements
The stakeholders outlined the following objectives for the dashboard:

1. **Customer Satisfaction**:
   - Measure overall customer satisfaction levels.

2. **Call Performance Metrics**:
   - Track total calls answered, abandoned, and missed.
   - Analyse call durations and average speed of answer.

3. **Agent Productivity**:
   - Assess agent performance through metrics such as calls answered, average handle time, and issues resolved.

4. **Operational Trends**:
   - Identify trends in calls by time and topics.
   - Visualise call distributions and peak periods.

5. **Actionable Insights**:
   - Provide insights to improve service quality and operational efficiency.
